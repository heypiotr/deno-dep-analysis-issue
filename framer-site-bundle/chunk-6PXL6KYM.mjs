        "text": "Framer is a no-code web builder that combines design and development in one easy-to-use platform. WordPress, on the other hand, is a CMS that often requires coding skills for customizations and relies on plugins for interactive features. Framer lets you design and publish without needing to rebuild or use external tools."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Both WordPress and Framer offer pricing tiers to suit websites of all sizes. However, WordPress often requires additional developer costs for custom builds and maintenance, which can increase the overall cost in both time and money. In contrast, Framer\u2019s no-code platform eliminates the need for specialized developers, reducing extra costs associated with customizations."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Framer requires no advanced technical skills, making it accessible to anyone. Its interface is similar to popular design tools like Figma and Sketch, so there\u2019s no steep learning curve if you\u2019re already using them. WordPress, on the other hand, can be overwhelming for users without a web development background and typically requires sourcing and onboarding of a WordPress specialized developer."
