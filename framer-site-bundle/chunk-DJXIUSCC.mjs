        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Framer is an all-in-one, no-code web builder that combines design and development in a single platform, allowing you to start from scratch or import Figma or Sketch projects directly. It emphasizes ease of use, speed, and collaboration without requiring HTML/CSS skills. Webflow, while powerful, leans more on HTML/CSS knowledge and often requires rebuilding designs created in other tools."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Framer offers a free tier with limited features and paid plans starting at around $10 per month for more advanced functionalities. Webflow also has a free tier for basic use, with paid plans starting at $18 per month for basic site plans and scaling up based on the complexity and needs of the project. Both platforms offer different plans tailored to individual or team use, so the best choice depends on your specific needs and budget."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No, Framer requires no HTML/CSS skills, making it accessible to anyone. Its interface is similar to popular design tools like Figma and Sketch, so there\u2019s no learning curve. Webflow, on the other hand, can be overwhelming for users without a web development background due to its reliance on HTML/CSS classes."
