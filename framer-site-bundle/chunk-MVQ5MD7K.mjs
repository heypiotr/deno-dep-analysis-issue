        "@type": "Answer",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A headless CMS separates content management from the frontend, unlike traditional systems where both are tightly integrated. In a traditional setup, duplicating or updating content across multiple instances also requires duplicating the frontend, making updates complex. By decoupling, a headless CMS allows content to be updated once and served across all frontends automatically. However, this approach requires building and maintaining two separate systems, leading to higher onboarding costs and ongoing coordination between teams for changes."

It\u2019s simple for anyone, like your team or clients, to update the site, and you can use filters to customize data display on the canvas."
